# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# you can also use the lsblk -o "<option>,<option>" this can be done like this:
# lsblk -o "NAME,MAJ:MIN,RM,SIZE,RO,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT,UUID"
# this wil give a full info about disk's and mount point for single partition/disk do this: 
# lsblk -o "NAME,MAJ:MIN,RM,SIZE,RO,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT,UUID" /dev/sda1
#
# <file system>                 <mount point>      <type>         <options>         <dump>  <pass>
# UUID=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX /PATH              FSTYPE	 noatime,defaults      0       0
